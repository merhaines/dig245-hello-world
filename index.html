Meredith Haines, Senior, Computer Science
I am interested in learning how to apply my programming knowledge for more creative uses such as frontend web development and design.
I took a Mobile Software Development class where I programmed android applications such as a calculator using Kotlin.
I want to become proficient in web languages like HTML and JavaScript and practice keeping the user experience in mind.
The Filesystem- A filesystem defines how files are named, stored, and retrieved from a device. These files are often grouped together in a hierarchical folder structure or "directories" originating at the root and branching out to various paths or file addresses. These files could also come in the form of a program or "application." Programs such as Microsoft Word are often packaged with other files which make up a software package like Microsoft Office. There are a set of permissions attached to each file which control whether the user can view, modify, or run that file. Common file extensions such as ".txt" for plain text, ".doc" for Microsoft Word, and ".html" for HyperText Markup Language are added to the end of a filename so that the user knows what type of file it is and so the operating system knows which applications can open which files. Hidden files exist on a computer, but do not appear when listing or exploring in the Finder. These files are often systems or configuration files hidden by default, but you can find them in the terminal using the -la flag.
