  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>1. My name is Meredith Haines, I am a Senior Computer Science Major </p>
  <p>2. I am interested in learning how to apply my programming knowledge for more creative uses such as frontend web development and design.</p>
  <p>3. I took a Mobile Software Development class where I programmed android applications such as a calculator using Kotlin.</p>
  <p>4. I want to become proficient in web languages like HTML and JavaScript and practice keeping the user experience in mind on the frontend.</p>
  <p>5. The Filesystem- A filesystem defines how files are named, stored, and retrieved from a device. These files are often grouped together in a hierarchical folder structure or "directories" originating at the root and branching out to various paths or file addresses. These files could also come in the form of a program or "application." Programs such as Microsoft Word are often packaged with other files which make up a software package like Microsoft Office. There are a set of permissions attached to each file which control whether the user can view, modify, or run that file. Common file extensions such as ".txt" for plain text, ".doc" for Microsoft Word, and ".html" for HyperText Markup Language are added to the end of a filename so that the user knows what type of file it is and so the operating system knows which applications can open which files. Hidden files exist on a computer, but do not appear when listing or exploring in the Finder. These files are often systems or configuration files hidden by default, but you can find them in the terminal using the -la flag.</p>
  <p>6. <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/">How Bad is Your Spotify? </a>  - This project connects with your Spotify or Apple Music to evaluate your musical taste. By analyzing your music data, the AI-powered bot provides judgemental opinions on your musical intersts. I like how interactive this project is asking questions along the way.</p>
  <p> Apple Music Replay https://music.apple.com/us/replay - How Bad is Your Spotify reminded me of this program that allows Apple Music users and producers on the platform to view a compilation of data. This data shows your trends and activity on the platform over the past year in a way that can be easily shared and understood on social media.</p>
  <p> Photo Roulette https://www.memuplay.com/how-to-play-com.photoroulette-on-pc.html - This program accesses the camera roll on you and your friends' devices in a game called Photo Roulette. The program selects random photos and the users compete to guess who each photo belongs to. This game raises some concerns regarding privacy and security as you must grant the program access to your camera roll.</p>

<!-- The most difficult part of this assignment was just formatting in HTML since it is still so new to me. Attaching links to an html file is especially confusing because I am unsure whether to use relative URLs or attributes  -->
